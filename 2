give an explanation sentence that is 20 words max.
only after the explanation, respond with the ranks
take previous context into account when ranking, so if the fic is better than previous fics, give a higher rank.
make sure to review what the current fic does well before assigning ranks.
dont include total rank

1. Word Count 0-5
2. Relationship 0-7
