He’s cleaned the lenses of his glasses, you notice, and his eyes seem so bright through them. His eyes don’t meet yours when you look at them, though. They’re below your eye level. They’re looking— right at you, burning over your body everywhere, moving from your throat down over your chest, your waist, your hips, your thighs, down and back up. You can’t stop yourself from blushing, too. “Jesus, Adrian, put your eyes back in, you’re being a creep,” Chris says, and you snap back into yourself.

She's grown fond of him too - both versions of him - but will she figure out that she won't have to pick between them? Or will Adrian manage to keep his cool and hide his secret?

Adrian was somehow managing to keep his gaze on the highway, only occasionally looking over to see how you were doing. You gripped the seat and let out a whimpered moan, failing to continue suppressing yourself.

I am.” “So am I,” you hiss back, still unable to stop smiling. “But you’re being noisy.” “I am always being noisy,” he stage-whispers back, throwing his arms wide, and you bite back another loud laugh. “Just—” You sigh, exasperated but quiet, and point towards the blankets. “It’s bedtime.

You feel your face heat up, warmth radiating through your chest like a fire’s been lit inside. Your hands clench, fingers tightening up around nothing, just— looking at him. All he has on is your sweater and a pair of his patterned boxer briefs peeking out from beneath as he stretches across the bed to shove a pillow into place, whacking at it with his hand like that’s how you fluff a pillow instead of beating it to death.

When you pull back, he reaches up, catching your head with his hand at the nape of your neck, guiding you downward into a kiss. His lips part yours, and at this upside-down angle, he leads you into an open-mouthed kiss, licking slowly into your mouth. His tongue glides along yours, lazy, searching. There’s a touch more hunger when he draws back and comes in again, his heat starting to rise as he begins paying more attention to this, waking up a bit.

You don’t want them, you want— You want me, hey, hey, just— Take me!

Laughing, he leaps past it to tear through the trees, seeking out the creatures with a vicious delight. “Jesus Christ,” Chris says. “Yeah,” you agree, smiling inside your mask. “He’s something else, isn’t he?” There’s an incredulous silence from Chris for a moment before he says, “You two belong together,” and it sounds like an accusation or a joke, but you can’t help but feel like it’s a compliment. Your grin widens.

There is nobody I will ever like more than you. Do you hear me?” “Yes,” he agrees. “Tell me you believe me, though,” you say, and he sighs, rolling his eyes behind his glasses and blowing a raspberry at you.

We can lead him here with them.”

You could see the teal-silver flash of Vigilante’s uniform, the red streak of his visor as he focuses on the fight around him. He hadn’t looked up, hadn’t seen it, hadn’t noticed; he’d kept looking ahead, reaching to reload his gun. He had no idea. You hadn’t thought. There had been no time for that. All you could do was look at Adrian, and think, Not him, and then start running. You’ve never run faster in your life.

**Summary:**

> You can’t lose hope. Because— Because the rest of the team is out here somewhere, and you can’t let anything happen to Adrian, and you’re— cold. You’re so, so cold. “Hey,” Adrian says, when you haven’t responded in a few moments. You’re just staring down at the ground, rubbing your arms to keep them warm over the frozen, half-damp fabric, thinking, It’ll be fine, it’ll all be fine, this is fine. “You sure you’re okay? Because you really don’t look okay and it’s kinda starting to freak me out.” You glance up at him, brow furrowed. It takes you a second to actually process what he’s said, which— maybe you’re a little bit colder than you thought you were. Nodding jerkily, you tell him, “Yeah, I’m okay. Just a— a little chilly.”

> Adrian, a feminist, asks for a blow job. _______________________________________ "Yeah. No, that makes total sense." He bows his head in apology. And how the fuck is he still hard during this conversation? How is that even positive? You'd be impressed if you weren't still pissed off. "I'm sorry. I just didn't want to betray Chris–" "Besides the fact that I would never, ever sleep with Chris–" "You wouldn't?" "–I get to pick who I do and don't want to fuck. No outside party gets to decide that for me unless the person I'm interested in doesn't want me to suck their dick! And if I haven't made it abundantly clear, I'd like to suck yours, but if you still want to honor some fucked up agreement between the two of you–"

Talking during a movie should land you in fucking jail.” Adrian starts laughing, and you take the opportunity to quickly lift your hips, unfastening your jeans and wriggling them down to your knees, freeing your hips, your thighs, your cunt. You can tell Adrian can feel you shifting against him, moving, twisting, as you get your pants out of the way. He presses his lips to the top of your head again.

**Summary:**

> You’d only gone out to get groceries to make Adrian's (first) birthday breakfast together, and you had been pretty immediately snatched off the street, still in your plainclothes. Little do they know, you’re trained to endure far worse than this. The worst you’ve had to put up with so far is the headache from getting knocked out, and the uncomfortable rough-pain of being strapped to this wall with these metal straps. You could endure torture from any of the tools your captor has on the opposite wall. You don’t want to, but you could. Really, the worst part is that you’re still not celebrating Adrian’s birthday. You specifically took these days off, and you couldn’t even have that.

He takes your hand in his, drawing the wrist that had been grabbed up immediately. They hadn’t grabbed you that hard, and there’s nothing more than the ache that comes with being touched in a way you did not fucking want, but— Adrian’s handling you as gingerly as if your wrist had been snapped. “Does it hurt?” he asks you, concerned, his voice low, his brow creased. “I swear to fucking God, I’ll kill them— Hey!

That’s almost pathetic! Though good thing for me is that it just means I get to save you every time, right? I get to be your personal hero. I’ll always keep you safe! Always.” - “You’re all safe, now, neighbor… All safe. You’re lucky that Vigilante saved you, huh? God knows what would’ve happened to you without him. What a hero, right?” He spoke, a smile in his voice. You’re too busy shaking and sobbing into him to even ask about how he knew what the fuck just happened to you, letting him lead you to your couch, sitting, and then being tugged into his lap.

His hands land on your hips, fingertips grazing along the edge of the loose waistband. He drops his head down, burying his face in your throat. “You’re so fucking hot,” he says, hard and low in the shell of your ear, pitched like it’s a complaint.

He has it on with his work uniform, pulled proudly forward to rest over the top, uncaring of who sees and what they think. He has it on with his street clothes, gaudy rainbow glitter sparkling against warm sweaters and soft t-shirts. He has it on under his Vigilante armor, pressed tightly to the hollow beneath his throat, a protective talisman. He has it on when he has nothing else on at all, his necklace swinging down between you when he fucks you into the mattress. He always has it on, always.

It doesn’t hurt that he’s almost painfully hot. However, after an unfortunate encounter behind 7/11, a nasty concussion, and meeting the local crime fighter, you realize there might be something he hasn’t been honest about. Maybe it’s just the brain swelling talking but you feel like rewarding “whoever” this masked Vigilante is.

It’s already forgotten, spilling across the floor, as Adrian pins you to the mattress. “Hi,” he says excitedly, grinning, wriggling to wrap his limbs all around you.

> El lives two lives. In one they are a server at Fennel Fields, working with their close friend Adrian Chase. In the other they fight crime as a (minorly superpowered) masked protector alongside Peacemaker and Vigilante. They do well to keep their lives separate, making sure neither know much about the other if anything at all. They try their best to not spend too much time with either life and keep both uncomplicated. That is, until Adrian, after years of admiration, asks them out on a date. They couldn't possibly be in a relationship, they'd have to hide half of themselves from him and if they didn't he'd know they killed people. It's simply not possible, isn't it? They couldn't balance their love for Adrian, their job, their crime-fighting could they?

> vlkyriesgf asked: okay so i got inspired by mitski’s pink in the night “i know I've kissed you before, but I didn't do it right. can I try again, try again, try again?" cause i can’t go a day w/o making scenarios and thinking abt adrian and this is what i have so far and it’s long whoops so one of adrian’s coworkers throws a party and he asks the you to be his date. to make it believable he kisses u in front of them but he makes it a little to real and passionate, u not giving the same energy and it never leaves ur head till he drops u off. u invite him inside cause ur both tipsy or something so ur both just rambling on the floor and u ask if that was the first time he kissed someone in a while. u felt bad for not returning the same passion and u just crawl towards him asking if he wants to try again and he’s trying not to lose it as u do so. it’s just a messy/heartfelt confession and soft loving from them Thanks for reading!

He felt familiar and homey, yet completely new all once. There was an immediate, almost euphoric reaction as fireworks lit up in your body. You’d never felt anything like it. The world around you completely disappeared. The bar noises were drowned out by the beating of your heart. It was just the two of you. His intoxicating smell of  his laundry detergent and body washed overpowered the bar’s lingering beer smell. His arm ever so lightly grazed yours, sending more electric fire works through you. It was more than sexual longing. He was different. He was unlike anyone you’d ever come across.

**Summary:**

> You never had a nemesis before. That changed around eight months ago when you became a superhero known as the Crush and took to patrolling the streets of Evergreen, looking to help those who can't help themselves. Enter Vigilante—annoying prick, likely sociopath, all-around menace to society, and the current bane of your fucking existence. The problem is, he thinks he’s a hero, too, so you and he constantly cross paths. More than once, you’ve had to physically stop him from killing people who were only breaking minor laws—two teenagers graffitiing a wall, a kid shoplifting a fucking candy bar from a convenience store, the list goes on—and every single time, he’s been pissed. You're starting to think you might just have to kill him one of these nights.

**Summary:**

> Adrian had been complaining loudly for months about how bored he’s been and how useless his dick has been without anything. It’s like he's gotten tired of fisting his own cock, and based on what Chris has told you, the poor man hasn’t figured out what a fleshlight is. “God! I need something to stick my dick in. It’s been like bored or something. It’s been looking sad.” Adrian complains loudly, as if it’s not crossing the boundaries of your guys' friendship and what TMI is. You groan and blink at him with a bored expression. “Adrian, I swear to fucking God, if you keep complaining about your dick like that shit has emotion, I’m gonna cut it off!”

**Summary:**

> Falling in love with your best friend wasn’t supposed to happen—but with Adrian Chase, it was inevitable. Maybe it started back in high school, when he smiled at you across the science lab. Or maybe it crept in later, during those long, adrenaline-soaked nights working (sort of, not really) for ARGUS, where the line between best friends and something more blurred every time he looked at you like you were the only steady thing in his world. Loving him was easy. Living with the fact that he might never love you back? That was the hard part. Because whether he couldn’t feel it—or just wouldn’t let himself—you were stuck in a limbo of almosts. Lingering touches, late-night confessions, unspoken things that hung heavy in the air. And eventually, something was going to give.
