**Summary:**

> Gillion rests against Jay on her bed, burying his face in the space where her neck and shoulder meet. She's so warm , the hand rubbing up and down his back almost searingly hot. He shifts in her lap, grumbling quietly to himself. "Feeling any better?" Jay asks quietly, reclining more against the wall. He readjusts accordingly, following her down. "A little." Heat ripples down his spine again and he whines quietly. "I just want to know what's wrong ." "I'm sorry, Gilly." Her blunt nails scratch gently at the base of his neck. "Maybe when we dock next, we can find a doctor who knows what's going on." For almost a week now, Gill's been unbearably on edge , flinching at everything. And he's been uncomfortably warm, like he's been in the sun too long—but jumping in the cool ocean doesn't do anything. The only thing that seems to help is skin to skin contact with someone. And Jay, wonderful, lovely Jay, is skipping the party on the Crescent Moon , just to keep him company. He shifts against her to get slightly more comfortable, relaxing at the press of her warm skin against his own.

**Summary:**

> Chip is sweating and blushing and, really, he shouldn't be. They're just friends, right? If Gillion can't come to his best friend to ask about human anatomy, then who can? Chip is certainly more sexually experienced than Gillion. He's been married and everything. He's practically a sex expert. Okay, Chip's first impulse was to pass the whole thing off as a joke, and he's almost sure that he'd decided to spin Gillion some ridiculous tale about getting pregnant through girls' belly buttons at some point, just to see if he'd believe it and bring it out at some embarrassingly inappropriate time. Somehow, though, he's found himself seriously explaining how human genitals work. No way this could go wrong.

**Summary:**

> In tritons, there's a little known fact about sexual hierarchy. The majority of tritons are betas, which have average cloacas and year-round sexuality. About 5% are alphas, which do not have hempenises and tend to be sexually dominant and aggressive year round. The scent from omegas in heat make them extremely aroused. A final 1% are omegas, which appear to be betas at first glance, with standard cloacas and hemipenes. However, they have practically no sexual desires except for when they go into heat for 1-2 days per month. During heat they are very fertile and emit a pheromone only noticeable by alphas, and feel extremely strong sexual urges. If bred while in heat, omegas gestate unusually quickly and lay eggs after a few hours.

**Summary:**

> Gillion had taken Chip in his arms and hugged him, and when that hadn't worked had kissed him. Kissed him with pool-wet lips like he expected Chip to drink from them, when Chip had, suddenly and overwhelmingly, wanted to drink straight from his tongue. Chip's romantic adventures had always been with himself as the dashing one. But strong, dripping blue arms against him, being dipped back with a dizzying lack of gravity, feeling suddenly helpless and surrounded, slightly panicked for just a minute and then... safe. Held. Supported. Overwhelmed. Kissed. He'd sprung to attention like a soldier on parade.

**Summary:**

> work in progress lmao get wrinesleyd And even then, deities should be repaid for their work - get a break for once in their life, maybe. They were made to be worshipped, but this blue fish one in particular only knew the other way around. If only - praying to him like a broken record to ask for something that was just for him again. Chip might've heard it with his sister, Edyn, even if it was just to not leave. Like Lunadeyis would take the garden of her away again in an instant. Until then, this might do. ~~~ chip wants to hear the drum of his friend's heart for a change
