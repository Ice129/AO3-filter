the user will input what they are looking for in a fanfic
create a simplified ranking system that the LLM can use to rank fics based on how well they fit the criteria
the ranking system is:
1. Word Count 0-7
2. Relationship 0-5
3. Overall Relevance 0-20

using this informtion, and the fact the rank will be generated from the fics tags, summary and title, create a mark scheme for the LLM to use to rank the fics.
break down how many points each criterion is worth.
Format the response clearly with headings and bullet points.
keep it concise, no non-essential formatting or information. 100 word overall limit
each category should have its own marking band.
no notes. no extra commentary.
just make a bullet point list of marking bands with headings.
